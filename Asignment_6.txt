Q4 Answer:
Class - It is a template or blueprint about the capability of what an object can do.
Object - An object (instance) is an instantiation of a class. When class is defined, only the description for the object is defined. Therefore, no memory or storage is allocated.
Attribute - Attributes are data stored inside a class or instance and represent the state or quality of the class or instance. In short, attributes store information about the instance.
Behavior - Behavior is the only way objects can do anything to themselves or have anything done to them.
